
# Custom control to provide a star rating.

This control allows the user to give a star rating by clicking one of the stars in the stack view. Clicking the same star again will set the rating back to 0. The amount and size of the stars can be set in storyboard with the use of IBDesignable/ IBInspectable.


I've made this class in service of [Pictureflow](https://pictureflow.app).
